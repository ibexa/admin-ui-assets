/**
 * Creates and manages a multi-level menu UI structure, suitable to be used inside dropdown components.
 *
 * This class creates a menu structure based on {@link module:ui/dropdown/menu/utils~DropdownMenuDefinition declarative definition}
 * passed in the constructor.
 *
 * Below is an example of a simple definition, that describes a menu with two sub-menus (Menu 1, Menu 2) and four buttons in total (Item A,
 * Item B, Item C, Item D):
 *
 * ```js
 * [
 * 	{
 * 		id: 'menu_1',
 * 		menu: 'Menu 1',
 * 		children: [
 * 			{ id: 'menu_1_a', label: 'Item A' },
 * 			{ id: 'menu_1_b', label: 'Item B' }
 * 		]
 * 	},
 * 	{
 * 		id: 'menu_2',
 * 		menu: 'Menu 2',
 * 		children: [
 * 			{ id: 'menu_2_c', label: 'Item C' },
 * 		]
 * 	},
 * 	{ id: 'item_d', label: 'Item D' }
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * The menu is build using multiple view classes. The most important are:
 *
 * * {@link module:ui/dropdown/menu/dropdownmenunestedmenuview~DropdownMenuNestedMenuView `DropdownMenuNestedMenuView`} - "menu" - provides
 * a panel with a nested menu, and a button which opens the panel,
 * * {@link module:ui/dropdown/menu/dropdownmenulistitembuttonview~DropdownMenuListItemButtonView `DropdownMenuListItemButtonView`} -
 * "button" or "leaf button" (as opposed to buttons provided by `DropdownMenuNestedMenuView`) - should trigger some action when pressed.
 *
 * Instances of these two classes are created based on the data provided in definitions. They are assigned proper IDs and labels.
 * Other view classes build a proper DOM structure around menus and buttons.
 *
 * The `DropdownMenuNestedMenuView` instances provides panels, which may include further menus or buttons. These panels are added to
 * a `BodyCollection` view, which means they are appended outside the DOM editor and UI structure.
 *
 * When "leaf button" is pressed, it fires `execute` event which is delegated to `DropdownMenuRootListView` as `menu:execute` event. You
 * can listen to this event to perform an action:
 *
 * ```js
 * rootListView.on( 'menu:execute', evt => {
 * 	console.log( evt.source.id ); // E.g. will print 'menu_1_a' when 'Item A' is pressed.
 * } );
 * ```
 *
 * All menus and "leaf" buttons created from the definition can be easily accessed through {@link ~DropdownMenuRootListView#menus `menus`}
 * and {@link ~DropdownMenuRootListView#buttons `buttons`} properties.
 *
 * For performance reasons, the whole menu structure is created only when `DropdownMenuRootListView` is rendered for the first time.
 *
 * It is recommended to use this class together with {@link module:ui/dropdown/utils~addMenuToDropdown `addMenuToDropdown()` helper}.
