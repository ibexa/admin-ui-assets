/**
 * The {@link module:autosave/autosave~Autosave} plugin allows you to automatically save the data (e.g. send it to the server)
 * when needed (when the user changed the content).
 *
 * It listens to the {@link module:engine/model/document~Document#event:change:data `editor.model.document#change:data`}
 * and `window#beforeunload` events and calls the
 * {@link module:autosave/autosave~AutosaveAdapter#save `config.autosave.save()`} function.
 *
 * ```ts
 * ClassicEditor
 * 	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
 * 		plugins: [ ArticlePluginSet, Autosave ],
 * 		toolbar: [ 'heading', '|', 'bold', 'italic', 'link', 'bulletedList', 'numberedList', 'blockQuote', 'undo', 'redo' ],
 * 		image: {
 * 			toolbar: [ 'imageStyle:block', 'imageStyle:side', '|', 'toggleImageCaption', 'imageTextAlternative' ],
 * 		},
 * 		autosave: {
 * 			save( editor: Editor ) {
 * 				// The saveData() function must return a promise
 * 				// which should be resolved when the data is successfully saved.
 * 				return saveData( editor.getData() );
 * 			}
 * 		}
 * 	} );
 * ```
