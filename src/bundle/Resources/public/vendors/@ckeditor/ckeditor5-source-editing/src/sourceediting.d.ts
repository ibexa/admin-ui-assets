     * the content it contains. The solution is to make the textarea more like a plain div element, which expands in height as much as it
     * needs to, in order to display the whole document source without scrolling. The wrapper element is a parent for the textarea and for
     * the pseudo-element `::after`, that replicates the look, content, and position of the textarea. The pseudo-element replica is hidden,
     * but it is styled to be an identical visual copy of the textarea with the same content. Then, the wrapper is a grid container and both
     * of its children (the textarea and the `::after` pseudo-element) are positioned within a CSS grid to occupy the same grid cell. The
     * content in the pseudo-element `::after` is set in CSS and it stretches the grid to the appropriate size based on the textarea value.
     * Since both children occupy the same grid cell, both have always the same height.
